# Game In

## Description

Game In is a web application born out of my family's growing passion for card games and the need for an efficient scoring system. This app replaces the traditional method of our family to use rolled-up napkin balls as visual cues for keeping score, which often led to a cluttered living space.

Key features of Game In include:

- Digital scorekeeping with visually appealing aqua-colored balls
- Note-taking functionality for each win
- Detailed logging of game outcomes to prevent disputes
- Statistics page tracking wins for each team over time

By providing a clean, digital alternative to physical score markers and offering ways to record and analyze game outcomes, Game In not only keeps your home tidy but also enhances the gaming experience by minimizing disagreements and offering insights into long-term performance.
